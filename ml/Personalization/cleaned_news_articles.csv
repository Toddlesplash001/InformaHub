BBC News,Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewne81lq4o,2025-04-24 16:28:07,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"". Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths. ""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York. ""Life is better off social media,"" he added, saying that he was ""grateful"" that his children were still too young to be online. ""The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,"" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. ""The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else."" The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost ""due to the harms of social media"". It will be open for 24 hours. The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media. Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children. They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy. The prince said tech firms were ""getting away with it"" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations. ""You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,"" he said. Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and ""one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe"". She praised the parents who were speaking out. ""I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Meghan. Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, agroup of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's officeson Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: ""It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally. ""There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem."" Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: ""All we're asking is... please help us protect our children."" A coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. ""Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said. The Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.The firm said it had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections. ""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended toimprove protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.

BBC News,UK edges towards post-Brexit youth visa deal with EU,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw58r0x0do,2025-04-24 18:34:01,"The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to ""reset"" relations after Brexit. Labour has previously said it has ""no plans"" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad. But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a ""running commentary"" on talks. It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a ""new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30"". In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would ""extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK"". Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May. Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made. ""They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month."" The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine. A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a €150bn (£128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme. Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a ""package approach"" to the talks, where different topics are linked together. He added that EU citizens had faced ""many obstacles"" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including ""very high thresholds"" for skilled work visas. The UKcurrently offers visasallowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year. These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed. Applicants from these countries need at least £2,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of £776 for students and £1,035 for workers. The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth dealin April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking ""differential treatment"" of EU citizens. Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued. It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit. There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap. Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that ""we have to leave that to the negotiations"". The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa. Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in an apparent bidto downplay any link to migration. But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement. During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked ""another avenue which people might use to game the system,"" adding that Labour ""doesn't know how to negotiate"". She added: ""Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?"" Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a ""huge number of people"" coming to the UK, adding it would be ""completely against what the Brexit vote demanded"". An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU. In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have ""nothing to do with migration"" as those taking part in the scheme would ""go home"" once their visa has ended.",article_html/UK edges towards post-Brexit youth visa deal with EU.html
BBC News,Student killed in French school stabbing attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787r15xngyo,2025-04-24 15:51:00,"One student has been killed and at least three people were injured in a stabbing at a privateschool in western France, French media say. The attack took place at Notre-Dame-de-Toutes-Aides school in Nantes on Thursday afternoon, according to reports. The attacker is said to have been arrested at the scene after being restrained by a teacher. A significant police presence and emergency services were sent to the school,with army officers also present. It has since been evacuated. Eye-witness accounts in local media described students running through the site, with some confined to classrooms after an alarm was sounded around lunch time. Families were informed of the knife attack and told students had been immediately held inside the school. Authorities helped students gradually leave the site from 15:30 local time (13:30 GMT), as some parents waited nearby. One father told the Reuters news agency they were ""waiting to hold them [our children] in our arms"" and ""help deal with the stress this will have caused"". The school has around 2,000 students and educates pupils from nursery through to high school, according to its website. Rue des Épinettes, where the school is located in the east of the city, has been closed off. France's education minister, interior minister and the regional president are to visit the scene on Thursday afternoon. Education minister Élisabeth Bornewrote on social mediathat she would ""express my solidarity with the victims"". Christelle Morançais, president of Pays de la Loire region, in which Nantes is situated, said she was ""devastated"" by the attack. Meanwhile, the city's mayor, Johanna Rolland, said her heart was ""filled with emotion at the atrocious tragedy"" that had occurred, adding that she had been at the school since the early afternoon. Nantes public prosecutor Antoine Leroy is said to have visited the school and will hold a news conference this evening.",article_html/Student killed in French school stabbing attack.html
BBC News,Mini heatwave expected as UK set for warmest temperatures of the year,https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c89g5wd3pzeo,2025-04-24 13:00:56,"If it feels a bit chilly now, just wait until next week when it will be much warmer. More sunshine and a change in the wind direction are expected to bring the warmest weather of the year so far. It might even be time to dust off the BBQ and apply the sunscreen. Saturday sees temperatures range from 13-17C with the possibility of western areas seeing some rain. Eastern parts of the UK are likely to stay dry but there will be a good deal of cloud. On Sunday the next band of rain will be pushed back to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, as pressure starts to rise, the cloud will break to leave sunnier skies and it will start to warm up. Sir Mo Farah crosses the finish line at the 2023 London Marathon The two largest marathons in the UK both take place on Sunday and many runners will be hoping the warmer weather starts a day later. TheLondonmarathon will be dry and mostly sunny with light winds. At the start of the race, temperatures will be 13C but for runners finishing around mid-afternoon it will be a warm 20 or 21C. For the marathon inManchesterthere will be spells of sunshine and it should stay dry. A gentle south-westerly breeze is expected with the temperature peaking at 17C in the afternoon. It starts to warm up on Sunday but temperatures will be much higher by Wednesday From early next week the temperatures continue to climb as the wind changes direction to a south-easterly and we tap into some warmer air from the near continent. Temperatures will climb widely to 22-23C and it will feel very pleasant in the sunshine. In the Midlands and south-east England temperatures are forecast to reach 25-27C by Wednesday. This will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September. It is not unusual to have these temperatures at this time of the year.

The Guardian,Tanzania opposition officials arrested as Tundu Lissu refuses to appear in court,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/tanzania-tundu-lissu-court-treason-opposition-detained,2025-04-24 14:07:23,"Chadema spokesperson says party’s vice-chair John Heche and secretary general John Mnyika held on way to protest over treason charges Tanzania’s main opposition party said on Thursday at least two of its officials had been arrested on their way to a rally to support the leading government opponent Tundu Lissu, who refused to appear at a virtual court hearing to face a charge of treason. Authorities in the east African country have increasingly cracked down on the opposition Chadema party ahead of presidential and parliamentary polls in October. Lissu’s party was disqualified from the forthcoming elections after it refused to sign an electoral code of conduct. Lissu himself could face the death penalty over the treason charge – his most serious threat yet despite multiple arrests over the years. Chadema hasaccused Tanzania’s president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, of returning to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli. “Some of our party officials have been arrested,” said the Chadema spokesperson Brenda Rupia, confirming to AFP that the party’s vice-chairperson, John Heche, and secretary general, John Mnyika, were among those detained by police. Lissu, 57, did not appear at a virtual hearing at Kisutu magistrates court in the country’s business capital, Dar es Salaam. Chadema said he had refused as conducting the hearing virtually “goes against the principle of transparency and the defendant’s right to a fair hearing”. Lissu has not been seen since a brief court appearance on 10 April, when he was charged with treason, which has no option of bail, and “publication of false information”. “The treason case is a path to liberation,” he said at the time. Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Outrage has grown over his detention, with hundreds of supporters gathering outside court.Amnesty Internationalhas called for his unconditional release. “Authorities are not doing justice to us. They forget that this is a country for us all,” said one supporter, Baraka Kunenga, 60. Lissu has led a forceful charge against the government, vowing that his party would not participate in polls without significant changes to the electoral system. Chadema’s refusal to sign an electoral “code of conduct” prompted its disqualification but the party has said its ban was unconstitutional. The president’s party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), won an overwhelming victory in local elections last year but Chadema says the vote was not free or fair since many of its candidates were disqualified. Chadema has demanded changes to voting, including a more independent electoral commission and clearer rules to ensure candidates are not removed from ballots. Lissu said last year that Chadema would “block the elections through confrontation” unless the system was improved. Its demands have long been ignored by the ruling party. A lawyer by training, Lissu entered parliament in 2010 and ran for president in 2020. He was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack that he says was ordered by his political opponents. Afterlosing the 2020 election to Magufuli, he fled the country. He returned in 2023 on a wave of optimism as Hassan moved to relax some of her predecessor’s restrictions on the opposition and the media. Those hopes proved short-lived. Rights groups and western governments are increasingly critical of renewed repression, including the arrests of Chadema politicians as well as abductions and murders of opposition figures. In Dar es Salaam, police erected a barricade around the court in the face of criticism from many who had gathered in protest. “I cannot believe this happening in our own country,” said one Chadema supporter, Aswile Mwaisanzu, 48.",article_html/Tanzania opposition officials arrested as Tundu Lissu refuses to appear in court.html
The Guardian,DRC government and M23 agree to halt fighting and work towards truce,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/drc-government-and-m23-make-surprise-truce-to-end-fighting-in-east-of-country,2025-04-24 12:28:37,"Both sides say they have resolved to end conflict through peaceful means after ‘frank’ talks facilitated by Qatar TheDemocratic Republic of the Congoand a coalition of militias including the Rwanda-backed M23 have agreed to work toward a truce to end the fighting that has engulfed the eastern part of the country since January. In similarly worded statements released on Wednesday night, the government and Alliance Fleuve Congo (Congo River Alliance) said their representatives had held talks facilitated byQatarand resolved to end the conflict through peaceful means. “After frank and constructive discussions, representatives of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 agreed to work towards concluding a truce that would contribute to the effectiveness of a ceasefire,”said the statement. “By mutual agreement, both parties reaffirm their commitment to an immediate cessation of hostilities, a categorical rejection of any hate speech, intimidation and call on all local communities to uphold these commitments.” The statement, the first such agreement the sides have announced jointly, described the talks as “frank and constructive” and said they were reaffirming their commitment to “an immediate end to hostilities”. Delegations from M23 and the Congolese government met in Doha this month. The latest mediation effort by Qatar, which has signed several economic cooperation agreements withRwandaand the DRC, came after the Arab country brokered a meeting between the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, in the capital last month. Both leaders called for a ceasefire after the meeting but it was not held. More than six truces and ceasefires have been agreed but failed since 2021. Delphin Ntanyoma, visiting researcher in peace and conflict studies at the University of Leeds, said while international pressure could sustain the Qatari-led process, questions remained over how it would be coordinated. He suggested it would be difficult to monitor the cessation of hostilities in “such a volatile and inaccessible large region of the Kivus” – referring to two provinces where fighting has taken place. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities,GomaandBukavu. The fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s vast natural resources. Rwanda denies this.

We cannot give in to every whim. Crimes have been committed. Some people must pay.” A source from the rebel alliance said the parties left Doha when the disagreements over the confidence-building measures became an unsurmountable obstacle to substantive talks.

Posting on Instagram, Emeka Rollas advocated spiritual intervention and better workplace regulation to try to prevent future tragedies after the two men, who have not yet been named, died on Friday. “So sad some Actors who are not members of the Actors Guild lost their lives while filming,” ran the message on his main post. “We have repeatedly warned that actors must join the guild to practice in Nollywood.” In a caption alongside, Rollas reflected that the deaths had occurred “barely a week after the [1 year] memorial service” ofJunior Pope, one of the country’s most influential actors and producers. Pope, 39, died on 10 April 2024 alongside three crew members in a boat accident on the River Niger, while travelling to Asaba to shoot a new film. Rollas concluded from the apparently unrelated events that “the devil still wants this pattern of mass death repeated on an annual basis”. Details of the deaths last weekend remain unclear but reports suggest the two actors died at a house party given by a director, which left two others hospitalised. The director and three other people present were later arrested. A spokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Henry Okoye, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the cause of the deaths had begun. “The command is aware of the unfortunate incident of unnatural death,” he said. “I can confirm that two people were pronounced dead while two were hospitalised.” In his Instagram post, Rollas credited God with the death toll in Owerri not being four – the same number, he said, as “last year in Asaba”. He continued by saying that he had organised a prayer programme before concluding with a caution to those who might sign up to work on productions without union representation. “This is a bad trend. These people camp themselves in an unhealthy, unverified environment making content,” wrote Rollas. “Content creators have to be licensed.RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭” Rollas has served as AGN president since 2017. In a 2019 speech, he said his organisation had more than two million registered members across 36 states and is the largest actors’ association inAfrica.",article_html/‘The devil wants this pattern of mass death repeated’ Actors Guild of Nigeria calls for better regul.html
The Guardian,‘I hope I’ll one day be at peace’: civilians seek mental health help in war-ravaged eastern DRC,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/i-hope-ill-one-day-be-at-peace-civilians-seek-mental-health-help-in-war-ravaged-eastern-drc,2025-04-22 09:00:03,"People traumatised by conflict have queued outside the Saint Vincent de Paul neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma each day since free scheme launched On a sunny morning in the city of Goma in easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting between the M23 rebel group and the Congolese army raged earlier this year, men and women rushed towards a line of chairs outside a medical facility. Since 24 March, the Saint Vincent de Paul neuropsychiatric hospital, a medical facility for people with mental health issues, has been offering free consultations on a first-come first-served basis for people affected by the fighting. Dozens have lined up to be seen each day. As she waited in the queue, 35-year-old Patience Kahindo described the horror she had witnessed at the peak of the fighting. “For the first time in my life, I saw corpses lying on the ground for days,” she said. “Crows and other birds came to eat the human flesh. Sometimes, when I think of all this, I’m plunged into unprecedented sadness. “If someone licked my heart, they’d be poisoned.” The fighting in eastern DRC has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis. M23, one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region, says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to DRC after taking part in the genocide. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s natural resources. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities –GomaandBukavu. The recent fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. Adding to that, peoplehave sustained serious long-term injuriesfrom shootings and bombings. And some Congolese displaced by previous rounds of fighting have been told by M23 to return their ruined home towns, where they arestruggling to make a living and rebuild their lives. “We have seen that since the clashes at the end of January, the population has been really stressed, and there has been a resurgence of mental health cases,” said Dr Neema Kahatwa, a psychiatrist from the neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma. When the hospital announced the scheme last month, the facility highlighted a number of symptoms that people could look out for and that could necessitate medical attention, including insomnia, difficulty in concentration, unexplained anger, extreme sadness, panic and loss of interest. As he queued to see a mental health specialist in one of four rooms at the facility, Jospin Kasereka, 42, described how he had lost his sister-in-law in the unchecked violence in Goma that followed its capture by M23 and how he saw Congolese soldiers throwing their weapons on the streets as they retreated. “Every day, I wonder of what use these weapons are to us. Perhaps, they were used to eliminate my sister-in-law,” he said. “Mentally, I’m cornered. I hope I’ll one day be at peace.” Obedi Alias, 47, has been out of work as a civil servant since rebels took over Goma. “I’ve got a big family to support, but there’s no work and I can’t find any money,” he said after his consultation. “I feel the pressure of carrying the whole world on my back. I feel helpless and fear for the future.” People who need to be checked first go to the reception, after which they are directed to the triage, where personnel check their vital signs. From there, they see psychiatrists, who prescribe additional tests and, if necessary, refer patients to psychologists for psychotherapy sessions. More than 300 people from Goma and its surroundings have gone through consultations since the campaign started. Stress, anxiety and depression have been among the conditions diagnosed. Although the consultations are free, the patients pay for other services, such as complementary examinations, laboratory tests and treatment. M23’s recent advance is the worst escalation in years of the conflict in eastern DRC. Attempts to end it through dialogue have failed. On Saturday the government suspended the former president Joseph Kabila’s political party and ordered his assets seized over accusations of supporting M23. The 53-year-old, who ruled from 2001 to 2019 and only stepped down after deadly protests against him, has said he wants to return to the country to help seek a solution to the war. There was no immediate response from Kabila, but Ferdinand Kambere, the secretary of his Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, called the suspension a flagrant violation of Congo’s constitution and laws.",article_html/‘I hope I’ll one day be at peace’ civilians seek mental health help in war-ravaged eastern DRC.html
The Guardian,Wild chimpanzees filmed by scientists bonding over alcoholic fruit,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/21/wild-chimpanzees-filmed-by-scientists-bonding-over-alcoholic-fruit,2025-04-21 15:00:40,"Footage of apes consuming fermented breadfruit leads researchers to ask if it may shed light on origins of human feasting  Humans have gathered to feast and enjoy a tipple togetherfor thousands of years, but research suggests chimpanzees may also bond over a boozy treat. Wild chimpanzees in westAfricahave been observed sharing fruit containing alcohol – not in quantities to get roaring drunk but, possibly, enough for a fuzzy beer buzz feeling. The researchers, led by scientists from theUniversity of Exeterin the UK, caught chimpanzees on film sharing fermented African breadfruit inGuinea-Bissau’s Cantanhez national park. “For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,” said Anna Bowland, from theCentre for Ecology and Conservationat Exeter’s Penryn campus in Cornwall. “We also know that sharing alcohol,including through traditions such as feasting, helps to form and strengthen social bonds. “Now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits, the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?” Using motion-activated cameras, the researchers filmed chimpanzees sharing the large, dense and fibrous fermented fruit on 10 occasions. The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV). “Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behaviour with fermented fruit might be important,” said Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter. Though the alcohol level is relatively low, the chimpanzees ate a lot of fruit every day so might ingest a fair quantity of alcohol, she said. “They can feed on kilograms of the stuff every day. It’s probably analogous to us sipping on a light beer.” Hockings and her colleagues published a paper in 2015 describing how chimpanzees in west Africastole and consumed palm sap alcohol created by humans. Some of them appeared to become troublesome, causing mischief such as not letting others build their night nests. The researchers behind the latest study, however, said chimpanzees were unlikely to get “drunk” on the breadfruit because it would not improve their survival chances. The sharing seemed to take place between all ages and sexes. Two adult females, nicknamed Chip and Até, were seen ignoring a larger hunk of breadfruit in favour of a smaller but fermented piece. Two adult males, Mandjambé and Gary, were observed approaching ripe breadfruit with aggressive stances. Mandjambé claimed a piece and began to feed, while another adult male, Bobby, kept Gary at bay. They all had a taste of the ripe breadfruit in the vicinity in the end. The paper, which appears in the journalCurrent Biologywith the title “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits”, asks the question: “Do the origins of feasting behaviour derive from a shared common ancestor?” Hockings said: “We need to find out more about whether the chimpanzees deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolise it, but this behaviour could be the early evolutionary stages of feasting. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.” She said the number of observations was small but they could lead to “an explosion” of research into the topic.",article_html/Wild chimpanzees filmed by scientists bonding over alcoholic fruit.html
