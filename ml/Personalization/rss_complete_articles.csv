BBC News,Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewne81lq4o,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:28:07 GMT","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"". Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths. ""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York. ""Life is better off social media,"" he added, saying that he was ""grateful"" that his children were still too young to be online. ""The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,"" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. ""The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else."" The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost ""due to the harms of social media"". It will be open for 24 hours. The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media. Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children. They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy. The prince said tech firms were ""getting away with it"" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations. ""You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,"" he said. Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and ""one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe"". She praised the parents who were speaking out. ""I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Meghan. Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, agroup of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's officeson Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: ""It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally. ""There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem."" Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: ""All we're asking is... please help us protect our children."" A coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. ""Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said. The Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.The firm said it had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections. ""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended toimprove protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.

BBC News,UK edges towards post-Brexit youth visa deal with EU,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw58r0x0do,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:34:01 GMT","The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to ""reset"" relations after Brexit. Labour has previously said it has ""no plans"" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad. But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a ""running commentary"" on talks. It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a ""new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30"". In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would ""extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK"". Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May. Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made. ""They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month."" The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine. A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a €150bn (£128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme. Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a ""package approach"" to the talks, where different topics are linked together. He added that EU citizens had faced ""many obstacles"" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including ""very high thresholds"" for skilled work visas. The UKcurrently offers visasallowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year. These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed. Applicants from these countries need at least £2,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of £776 for students and £1,035 for workers. The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth dealin April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking ""differential treatment"" of EU citizens. Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued. It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit. There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap. Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that ""we have to leave that to the negotiations"". The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa. Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in an apparent bidto downplay any link to migration. But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement. During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked ""another avenue which people might use to game the system,"" adding that Labour ""doesn't know how to negotiate"". She added: ""Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?"" Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a ""huge number of people"" coming to the UK, adding it would be ""completely against what the Brexit vote demanded"". An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU. In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have ""nothing to do with migration"" as those taking part in the scheme would ""go home"" once their visa has ended.",article_html/UK edges towards post-Brexit youth visa deal with EU.html

The attacker is said to have been arrested at the scene after being restrained by a teacher. A significant police presence and emergency services were sent to the school,with army officers also present. It has since been evacuated. Eye-witness accounts in local media described students running through the site, with some confined to classrooms after an alarm was sounded around lunch time. Families were informed of the knife attack and told students had been immediately held inside the school. Authorities helped students gradually leave the site from 15:30 local time (13:30 GMT), as some parents waited nearby. One father told the Reuters news agency they were ""waiting to hold them [our children] in our arms"" and ""help deal with the stress this will have caused"". The school has around 2,000 students and educates pupils from nursery through to high school, according to its website.

More sunshine and a change in the wind direction are expected to bring the warmest weather of the year so far. It might even be time to dust off the BBQ and apply the sunscreen. Saturday sees temperatures range from 13-17C with the possibility of western areas seeing some rain. Eastern parts of the UK are likely to stay dry but there will be a good deal of cloud. On Sunday the next band of rain will be pushed back to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, as pressure starts to rise, the cloud will break to leave sunnier skies and it will start to warm up.

TheLondonmarathon will be dry and mostly sunny with light winds. At the start of the race, temperatures will be 13C but for runners finishing around mid-afternoon it will be a warm 20 or 21C. For the marathon inManchesterthere will be spells of sunshine and it should stay dry. A gentle south-westerly breeze is expected with the temperature peaking at 17C in the afternoon. It starts to warm up on Sunday but temperatures will be much higher by Wednesday From early next week the temperatures continue to climb as the wind changes direction to a south-easterly and we tap into some warmer air from the near continent. Temperatures will climb widely to 22-23C and it will feel very pleasant in the sunshine. In the Midlands and south-east England temperatures are forecast to reach 25-27C by Wednesday. This will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September. It is not unusual to have these temperatures at this time of the year.

President Trump called on President Vladimir V. Putin to “STOP!” in a post on social media. ByKim BarkerandMaria Varenikova Photographs byBrendan Hoffman Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine Russia killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others in a huge attack on the Ukrainian capital early Thursday, prompting President Trump to issue a rare public critique of Moscow just hours after helashed out at President Volodymyr Zelenskyof Ukraine. The assault was the deadliest on the capital, Kyiv, since last summer. Explosions shook buildings and sent more than 16,000 people into the subway system to take shelter; clouds of smoke rose over the city as the sun came up. One missile hit a two-story building with 12 apartments where emergency workers hunted for survivors. A five-story building next door lost all its windows. People stood outside, staring at the damage and talking on their phones, telling loved ones that they were alive. No military target was visible nearby. Mr. Zelensky said nearly 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and about 150 attack drones had targeted cities across the country — although Kyiv was hit the hardest. About the same time, Mr. Trump lashed out at President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about the attack, showing how his administration’s positions can seem to flip-flop without warning. “Vladimir, STOP!” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, saying that he was “not happy” with the Russian strikes. “Not necessary, and very bad timing,” the post added.

Bromwich A lawyer for New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, sent a lengthy letter to the Justice Department on Thursday, attacking President Trump for “improper political retribution” as the government scrutinizes her real estate transactions. Abbe Lowell, a high-profile lawyer retained by the attorney general in recent days, was responding toa criminal referral letter sent to the Justice Department last weekby Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Mr. Pulte’s letter focused on two houses that Ms. James owns in Virginia and New York. It said that she “appeared to have falsified records” related to the properties, which might have allowed her to receive favorable loan terms. But Mr. Lowell, in his own letter to Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, said Mr. Pulte’s allegation lacked “any credible foundation.” He characterized them as “the next salvo in President Trump’s revenge tour against Attorney General James.” “The stunning hypocrisy of President Trump’s complaint that the Justice Department had been ‘politicized’ and ‘weaponized’ against him is laid bare as he and others in his administration are now asking you to undertake the very same practice,” Mr. Lowell wrote to Ms. Bondi.

The Guardian,Tanzania opposition officials arrested as Tundu Lissu refuses to appear in court,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/tanzania-tundu-lissu-court-treason-opposition-detained,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:07:23 GMT","Chadema spokesperson says party’s vice-chair John Heche and secretary general John Mnyika held on way to protest over treason charges Tanzania’s main opposition party said on Thursday at least two of its officials had been arrested on their way to a rally to support the leading government opponent Tundu Lissu, who refused to appear at a virtual court hearing to face a charge of treason. Authorities in the east African country have increasingly cracked down on the opposition Chadema party ahead of presidential and parliamentary polls in October. Lissu’s party was disqualified from the forthcoming elections after it refused to sign an electoral code of conduct. Lissu himself could face the death penalty over the treason charge – his most serious threat yet despite multiple arrests over the years. Chadema hasaccused Tanzania’s president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, of returning to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli. “Some of our party officials have been arrested,” said the Chadema spokesperson Brenda Rupia, confirming to AFP that the party’s vice-chairperson, John Heche, and secretary general, John Mnyika, were among those detained by police. Lissu, 57, did not appear at a virtual hearing at Kisutu magistrates court in the country’s business capital, Dar es Salaam. Chadema said he had refused as conducting the hearing virtually “goes against the principle of transparency and the defendant’s right to a fair hearing”. Lissu has not been seen since a brief court appearance on 10 April, when he was charged with treason, which has no option of bail, and “publication of false information”. “The treason case is a path to liberation,” he said at the time. Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Outrage has grown over his detention, with hundreds of supporters gathering outside court.Amnesty Internationalhas called for his unconditional release. “Authorities are not doing justice to us. They forget that this is a country for us all,” said one supporter, Baraka Kunenga, 60. Lissu has led a forceful charge against the government, vowing that his party would not participate in polls without significant changes to the electoral system. Chadema’s refusal to sign an electoral “code of conduct” prompted its disqualification but the party has said its ban was unconstitutional. The president’s party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), won an overwhelming victory in local elections last year but Chadema says the vote was not free or fair since many of its candidates were disqualified. Chadema has demanded changes to voting, including a more independent electoral commission and clearer rules to ensure candidates are not removed from ballots. Lissu said last year that Chadema would “block the elections through confrontation” unless the system was improved. Its demands have long been ignored by the ruling party. A lawyer by training, Lissu entered parliament in 2010 and ran for president in 2020. He was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack that he says was ordered by his political opponents. Afterlosing the 2020 election to Magufuli, he fled the country. He returned in 2023 on a wave of optimism as Hassan moved to relax some of her predecessor’s restrictions on the opposition and the media. Those hopes proved short-lived. Rights groups and western governments are increasingly critical of renewed repression, including the arrests of Chadema politicians as well as abductions and murders of opposition figures. In Dar es Salaam, police erected a barricade around the court in the face of criticism from many who had gathered in protest. “I cannot believe this happening in our own country,” said one Chadema supporter, Aswile Mwaisanzu, 48.",article_html/Tanzania opposition officials arrested as Tundu Lissu refuses to appear in court.html

In similarly worded statements released on Wednesday night, the government and Alliance Fleuve Congo (Congo River Alliance) said their representatives had held talks facilitated byQatarand resolved to end the conflict through peaceful means. “After frank and constructive discussions, representatives of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 agreed to work towards concluding a truce that would contribute to the effectiveness of a ceasefire,”said the statement. “By mutual agreement, both parties reaffirm their commitment to an immediate cessation of hostilities, a categorical rejection of any hate speech, intimidation and call on all local communities to uphold these commitments.” The statement, the first such agreement the sides have announced jointly, described the talks as “frank and constructive” and said they were reaffirming their commitment to “an immediate end to hostilities”. Delegations from M23 and the Congolese government met in Doha this month. The latest mediation effort by Qatar, which has signed several economic cooperation agreements withRwandaand the DRC, came after the Arab country brokered a meeting between the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, in the capital last month. Both leaders called for a ceasefire after the meeting but it was not held. More than six truces and ceasefires have been agreed but failed since 2021. Delphin Ntanyoma, visiting researcher in peace and conflict studies at the University of Leeds, said while international pressure could sustain the Qatari-led process, questions remained over how it would be coordinated. He suggested it would be difficult to monitor the cessation of hostilities in “such a volatile and inaccessible large region of the Kivus” – referring to two provinces where fighting has taken place. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities,GomaandBukavu. The fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s vast natural resources. Rwanda denies this.

We cannot give in to every whim. Crimes have been committed. Some people must pay.” A source from the rebel alliance said the parties left Doha when the disagreements over the confidence-building measures became an unsurmountable obstacle to substantive talks.

Posting on Instagram, Emeka Rollas advocated spiritual intervention and better workplace regulation to try to prevent future tragedies after the two men, who have not yet been named, died on Friday. “So sad some Actors who are not members of the Actors Guild lost their lives while filming,” ran the message on his main post. “We have repeatedly warned that actors must join the guild to practice in Nollywood.” In a caption alongside, Rollas reflected that the deaths had occurred “barely a week after the [1 year] memorial service” ofJunior Pope, one of the country’s most influential actors and producers. Pope, 39, died on 10 April 2024 alongside three crew members in a boat accident on the River Niger, while travelling to Asaba to shoot a new film. Rollas concluded from the apparently unrelated events that “the devil still wants this pattern of mass death repeated on an annual basis”. Details of the deaths last weekend remain unclear but reports suggest the two actors died at a house party given by a director, which left two others hospitalised. The director and three other people present were later arrested. A spokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Henry Okoye, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the cause of the deaths had begun. “The command is aware of the unfortunate incident of unnatural death,” he said. “I can confirm that two people were pronounced dead while two were hospitalised.” In his Instagram post, Rollas credited God with the death toll in Owerri not being four – the same number, he said, as “last year in Asaba”. He continued by saying that he had organised a prayer programme before concluding with a caution to those who might sign up to work on productions without union representation. “This is a bad trend. These people camp themselves in an unhealthy, unverified environment making content,” wrote Rollas. “Content creators have to be licensed.RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭” Rollas has served as AGN president since 2017.

The Guardian,‘I hope I’ll one day be at peace’: civilians seek mental health help in war-ravaged eastern DRC,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/i-hope-ill-one-day-be-at-peace-civilians-seek-mental-health-help-in-war-ravaged-eastern-drc,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:00:03 GMT","People traumatised by conflict have queued outside the Saint Vincent de Paul neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma each day since free scheme launched On a sunny morning in the city of Goma in easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting between the M23 rebel group and the Congolese army raged earlier this year, men and women rushed towards a line of chairs outside a medical facility. Since 24 March, the Saint Vincent de Paul neuropsychiatric hospital, a medical facility for people with mental health issues, has been offering free consultations on a first-come first-served basis for people affected by the fighting. Dozens have lined up to be seen each day. As she waited in the queue, 35-year-old Patience Kahindo described the horror she had witnessed at the peak of the fighting. “For the first time in my life, I saw corpses lying on the ground for days,” she said. “Crows and other birds came to eat the human flesh. Sometimes, when I think of all this, I’m plunged into unprecedented sadness. “If someone licked my heart, they’d be poisoned.” The fighting in eastern DRC has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis. M23, one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region, says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to DRC after taking part in the genocide. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s natural resources. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities –GomaandBukavu. The recent fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. Adding to that, peoplehave sustained serious long-term injuriesfrom shootings and bombings. And some Congolese displaced by previous rounds of fighting have been told by M23 to return their ruined home towns, where they arestruggling to make a living and rebuild their lives. “We have seen that since the clashes at the end of January, the population has been really stressed, and there has been a resurgence of mental health cases,” said Dr Neema Kahatwa, a psychiatrist from the neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma. When the hospital announced the scheme last month, the facility highlighted a number of symptoms that people could look out for and that could necessitate medical attention, including insomnia, difficulty in concentration, unexplained anger, extreme sadness, panic and loss of interest. As he queued to see a mental health specialist in one of four rooms at the facility, Jospin Kasereka, 42, described how he had lost his sister-in-law in the unchecked violence in Goma that followed its capture by M23 and how he saw Congolese soldiers throwing their weapons on the streets as they retreated. “Every day, I wonder of what use these weapons are to us. Perhaps, they were used to eliminate my sister-in-law,” he said. “Mentally, I’m cornered. I hope I’ll one day be at peace.” Obedi Alias, 47, has been out of work as a civil servant since rebels took over Goma. “I’ve got a big family to support, but there’s no work and I can’t find any money,” he said after his consultation. “I feel the pressure of carrying the whole world on my back. I feel helpless and fear for the future.” People who need to be checked first go to the reception, after which they are directed to the triage, where personnel check their vital signs. From there, they see psychiatrists, who prescribe additional tests and, if necessary, refer patients to psychologists for psychotherapy sessions. More than 300 people from Goma and its surroundings have gone through consultations since the campaign started. Stress, anxiety and depression have been among the conditions diagnosed. Although the consultations are free, the patients pay for other services, such as complementary examinations, laboratory tests and treatment. M23’s recent advance is the worst escalation in years of the conflict in eastern DRC. Attempts to end it through dialogue have failed. On Saturday the government suspended the former president Joseph Kabila’s political party and ordered his assets seized over accusations of supporting M23. The 53-year-old, who ruled from 2001 to 2019 and only stepped down after deadly protests against him, has said he wants to return to the country to help seek a solution to the war. There was no immediate response from Kabila, but Ferdinand Kambere, the secretary of his Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, called the suspension a flagrant violation of Congo’s constitution and laws.",article_html/‘I hope I’ll one day be at peace’ civilians seek mental health help in war-ravaged eastern DRC.html
The Guardian,Wild chimpanzees filmed by scientists bonding over alcoholic fruit,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/21/wild-chimpanzees-filmed-by-scientists-bonding-over-alcoholic-fruit,"Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:00:40 GMT","Footage of apes consuming fermented breadfruit leads researchers to ask if it may shed light on origins of human feasting  Humans have gathered to feast and enjoy a tipple togetherfor thousands of years, but research suggests chimpanzees may also bond over a boozy treat. Wild chimpanzees in westAfricahave been observed sharing fruit containing alcohol – not in quantities to get roaring drunk but, possibly, enough for a fuzzy beer buzz feeling. The researchers, led by scientists from theUniversity of Exeterin the UK, caught chimpanzees on film sharing fermented African breadfruit inGuinea-Bissau’s Cantanhez national park. “For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,” said Anna Bowland, from theCentre for Ecology and Conservationat Exeter’s Penryn campus in Cornwall. “We also know that sharing alcohol,including through traditions such as feasting, helps to form and strengthen social bonds. “Now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits, the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?” Using motion-activated cameras, the researchers filmed chimpanzees sharing the large, dense and fibrous fermented fruit on 10 occasions. The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV). “Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behaviour with fermented fruit might be important,” said Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter. Though the alcohol level is relatively low, the chimpanzees ate a lot of fruit every day so might ingest a fair quantity of alcohol, she said. “They can feed on kilograms of the stuff every day. It’s probably analogous to us sipping on a light beer.” Hockings and her colleagues published a paper in 2015 describing how chimpanzees in west Africastole and consumed palm sap alcohol created by humans. Some of them appeared to become troublesome, causing mischief such as not letting others build their night nests. The researchers behind the latest study, however, said chimpanzees were unlikely to get “drunk” on the breadfruit because it would not improve their survival chances. The sharing seemed to take place between all ages and sexes. Two adult females, nicknamed Chip and Até, were seen ignoring a larger hunk of breadfruit in favour of a smaller but fermented piece. Two adult males, Mandjambé and Gary, were observed approaching ripe breadfruit with aggressive stances. Mandjambé claimed a piece and began to feed, while another adult male, Bobby, kept Gary at bay. They all had a taste of the ripe breadfruit in the vicinity in the end. The paper, which appears in the journalCurrent Biologywith the title “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits”, asks the question: “Do the origins of feasting behaviour derive from a shared common ancestor?” Hockings said: “We need to find out more about whether the chimpanzees deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolise it, but this behaviour could be the early evolutionary stages of feasting. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.” She said the number of observations was small but they could lead to “an explosion” of research into the topic.

Rahul Gandhi, who was on an official visit to the United States, cut his trip short and returned to New Delhi early Thursday morning. Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also shortened their trips to Saudi Arabia and the US, respectively, in response to the attack in Pahalgam. Earlier in the day, the Central government convened an all-party meeting to deliberate on the security situation and formulate a collective response to the attack.  Following the attack, India has taken strong countermeasures against Pakistan for its support of cross-border terrorism. In the Cabinet Committee on Security meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the presence of Home Minister Amit Shah, India decided to hold the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism and has closed the integrated Attari Check Post. India has also declared the officials of the Pakistani High Commission persona non grata and ordered them to leave India within a week. The country further decided to cancel any visas provided under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) and ordered Pakistan to leave the country within 48 hours. The Government of India has also decided to suspend visa services for Pakistani nationals, effective immediately. All existing valid visas issued by India to Pakistani nationals will stand revoked, effective from 27 April 2025, the Ministry of External Affairs stated in a press release. Meanwhile, families of victims of the Pahalgam terror attack mourned the loss of their loved ones as they urged the government to take strong action against the perpetrators of the heinous crime. Last rites of Indian Navy Lieutenant Vinay Narwal, who was killed in the Pahalgam terror attack, were performed at his native place in Karnal. Shivamogga resident Manjunath Rao was killed in the terror attack. Family friend Dattatreya urged the government to take strong steps against terrorists. Terrorists attacked tourists at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on Tuesday, killing 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen while leaving several others injured, in one of the deadliest attacks in the valley since the 2019 Pulwama strike in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

Twenty six tourists - 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen - died in theattack on Tuesdayat Baisaran, dubbed 'mini Switzerland' for its meadow. The Resistance Front, a shadow group of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group, claimed responsibility. As India downgraded diplomatic ties with Pakistan and announced a raft of measures, including suspension of theIndus Waters Treatyof 1960, on Wednesday,Pakistan on Thursday saidany move to divert water meant for it under the pact will be considered an ""Act of War"". Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the accused in the terror attack will be pursued ""to the ends of the earth"" and promised to ""identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers"". Officials have released the followinghelpline numbers: Emergency Control Room - Srinagar: 0194-2457543, 0194-2483651; 7006058623; 24/7 Tourist Help Desk - Police Control Room, Anantnag 9596777669, 01932-225870, WhatsApp: 9419051940; Jammu and Kashmir Tourist Department - 8899931010, 8899941010, 9906663868, 9906906115. Chants of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' rang out at the Gandhi Hall in the High Commission of India in London on Thursday as a large diaspora gathering paid their respects to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The sombre prayer meet, led by Indian High Commissioner to the UK Vikram Doraiswami, was marked by the stark images from Tuesday's attack in the Kashmir Valley. The event was addressed by cross-party British parliamentarians, including diaspora organisations such as Labour Indians, and followed the matter being raised in the British Parliament earlier on Thursday. ""UK stands shoulder to shoulder in the face of cowardly attacks of terrorism against innocent civilians,"" said Catherine West, Foreign Office minister in charge of the Indo-Pacific. ""Both the Upper House and in the House of Commons, we had very solemn words from both sides of the House today, remembering those families, those victims. We must pull together at dangerous times like this, emphasise an element of justice, but also put our arms around the families and the communities who are in deep sorrow,"" she said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the opposition raised the issue of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's absence at Thursday's crucial all-party meeting on the Pahalgam terror attack as well as the ""security lapse"" in the incident but extended full support to the government in dealing with terrorism. Mallikarjun Kharge said everyone present at the meeting condemned the attack, which claimed 26 lives, and opposition parties asserted that they will fully cooperate with the government on this issue to give a message that the country is united. Addressing reporters after the all-party meeting chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Mallikarjun Kharge said the Congress pointed out that PM Modi should have joined the meeting because he has the power to take the final decision. ""We emphasised that his (PM's) presence is important as he can take decisions but they (government) said that they will explain (or brief) later. We said explaining is one thing and taking a decision by hearing things first hand is another,"" the Congress president said. ""Secondly, we raised the question about the security lapse... There is three-tier security but in spite of that, how did such a lapse take place and a lot of innocents have died,"" Mallikarjun Kharge said. PB Fintech, the parent company of Policybazaar and Paisabazaar, is creating a foundation to support all impacted families of the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed, co-founder Alok Bansal said. He said the company would offer jobs in any of their offices to one family member of each victim and sponsor the education of their children. ""We have decided to create a foundation to support all impacted families,"" Mr Bansal wrote on Linkedin. ""We sure hope that no one has to go through this pain ever, but we will try our best to be always available to support every Indian family, be it civilian, police personnel, paramilitary or armed forces."" The Executive Vice Chairman also spoke of the emotional impact the attack had on the Policybazaar team. ""Everyone I know has been disturbed since the Pahalgam terrorist attack news was reported. For us at Policybazaar, this deliberate brutality has shaken us to the core. The overwhelming feeling is a mix of helplessness and anger. What has happened is reprehensible and the suffering is unimaginable,"" he wrote. Asavari Jagdale, whose father Santosh Jagdale and uncle Kaustubh Ganbote were killed in the Pahalgam terror attack, said the perpetrators were not humans but demons. ""They were not humans. They were demons,"" said 26-year-old Asavari, who showed courage in the face of terror by providing support to her mother and Ganbote's wife Sangita at the site of the carnage and later at the hospital. ""While we were busy doing photoshoots at the point called Mini Switzerland in Baisaran Valley, we suddenly heard gunshots. We asked some locals about it and they claimed locals open fire to scare away tigers. However, the horror of the moment dawned on us as we saw people getting shot, while others were reciting the kalma. We knew this was different,"" she recounted. ""One of the terrorists, in his early 20s, asked my father to get up. My father urged him not to harm them. He coldly said he will show us how to kill and sprayed three bullets, one of which hit my father on the head, another going through the ear and the third getting lodged in his chest,"" Asavari said.  In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Long Term Visas (LTVs) already issued to Hindu Pakistani nationals will remain valid.

About 500 tourists from Maharashtra have returned to the state in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack, officials said on Thursday evening, adding that another 232 tourists would arrive by a special flight on Friday. Six tourists from Maharashtra were among the 26 persons killed in Tuesday's attack in Jammu and Kashmir. A statement from the Chief Minister's Office here said the state government had arranged a special flight each of IndiGo and Air India. As many as 184 tourists have arrived in Mumbai, it said while not giving details of how other tourists returned. Another 232 tourists will be brought back by a special flight on Friday, it said. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had asked disaster management minister Girish Mahajan to go to Kashmir after the incident. India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 with immediate effect. The government said it will remain suspended unless Pakistan credibly and irrevocably stops support for cross-border terrorism.The integrated check post Attari was closed on Wednesday. People who crossed over with endorsements are allowed to return through that route before May 1.The government no longer allowed Pakistani nationals to travel to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) visas. SVES visas issued earlier to Pakistani nationals were cancelled. And all Pakistanis holding SVES visas were told to leave India in 48 hours.The defence/military, naval and air advisors in the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi were declared persona non grata, and given a week to leave the country. India also announced it would withdraw its defence staff from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.India said it would bring down the overall strength of the High Commissions to 30 from the present 55 through further reductions, to be done by May 1.The government today suspended visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect. It told all Pakistani nationals to leave India by April 27. However, those who hold medical visas can stay only till April 29.The Border Security Force (BSF) took a calibrated decision to scale down the ceremonial display during the Retreat Ceremony at Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadki in Punjab. The key changes include suspension of the symbolic handshake of the Indian Guard Commander with the counterpart Guard Commander. The gates will remain closed during the ceremony. This step reflects India's serious concern over cross-border hostilities and reaffirms that peace and provocation cannot coexist, the BSF said. A resident of Indore, Sushil Nathaniel, who worked as a branch manager for LIC, was killed, with his daughter Akanksha sustaining bullet injuries in the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. Mr Nathaniel had gone to Jammu and Kashmir on April 19 along with his wife, son and daughter. His brother, Vikas, spoke to ANI and shared that they received information about the matter on Tuesday night around 9:30 pm, after Sushil's son, Ostin, called them. ""Jenifer bhabhi said that the terrorist asked Sushil bhaiya to recite Kalima on his knees, following which bhaiya reciprocated that he was Christian, and bhaiya told bhabhi to move aside from there. In the meantime, the terrorist shot bhaiya, and he died on the spot. Our niece, Akansha also sustained bullet injuries in her leg,"" Vikas said. The barbarism displayed in the Pahalgam terror attack is totally unacceptable, French President Emmanuel Macron told Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone conversation on Thursday. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also dialled PM Modi and strongly condemned the ""terrible"" terror attack on Indian soil, according to external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. International flights, especially from Delhi and other northern cities, will take a longer time to reach their destinations and fares are also likely to rise in the range of 8-12 per cent in the near term, with Pakistan closing its airspace for Indian airlines. Air India and IndiGo on Thursday said some of its international flights have been impacted by the Pakistan airspace closure, with the Tata Group-owned airline mentioning that its flights connecting North America, UK, Europe and Middle East are likely to take an alternative extended route. Apart from IndiGo and Air India, Air India Express and SpiceJet also have international operations. All West-bound flights flying from north Indian cities, including Delhi, will be impacted due to the closure. These flights will have to take alternative routes that will be longer over the Arabian Sea, according to senior airline officials and pilots. With longer routes, airlines will need more fuel to operate the flights resulting in higher costs as well as deal with payload issues. To bring back stranded tourists from Jammu & Kashmir, the civil aviation ministry said 110 flights, including eight additional services, were operated connecting Srinagar airport, which handled more than 14,000 passengers on Thursday and highlighted that airfares on the route have reduced notably in two days. Amid many people expressing concerns over high airfares, the ministry said for connecting flights, airlines typically implement a fare structure that aggregates the costs of each individual segment of the journey and also that in certain cases, economy class and business class ticket prices get intermingled.

Addressing a press conference here, he said, ""Our government has decided to offer this small amount as a token of respect for the sacrifice made by the deceased and their families."" Twenty-six people, mostly tourists, were killed in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on Tuesday. Sarma said strict watch is being kept along the state's border with Bangladesh also. ""We are concerned about Bangladesh. There has been hobnobbing between Bangladesh and Pakistan. We have alerted our security agencies to keep watch and remain vigilant,"" he said. India has ramped up its response to the Pahalgam terror attacks, revoking all visas issued to Pakistani nationals, including medical visas, and suspending visa services for Pakistanis. Islamabad has tried to mirror New Delhi's decisions and has taken several measures as the diplomatic standoff escalates. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a rare National Security Committee (NSC) meeting today and took several decisions, during which the committee said it ""Shall exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to the Simla Agreement in abeyance."" The Simla Agreement brought into existence the Line of Control, a boundary demarcating the positioning of the armies of both sides, which resulted from the December 17, 1971, cease-fire following the 14-day war and India's decisive victory. The agreement has been violated in the past by Pakistan.Click here to read more Jennifer, wife of Sushil Nathaniel who killed in the Kashmir terror attack, told ANI: ""My husband told me he needed to use the washroom...

His last rites were held in Karnal last evening. The Border Security Force (BSF) said it has ""scaled down"" the retreat ceremony held at Attari, Hussainiwala and Sadki along the India-Pakistan border in Punjab in the wake of the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The Jalandhar-headquartered BSF's Punjab frontier, which guards 532 km of this front out of the total 2,200 km, said in a statement that as part of a ""calibrated decision"", it was ""suspending"" the symbolic handshake of the Indian guard commander with its counterpart and the border gates will remain closed during the ceremony. These steps, it said, reflected ""India's serious concern over cross-border hostilities and reaffirms that peace and provocation cannot coexist"".

The police have identified two of the suspects as Pakistani nationals and have announced a reward of Rs 20 lakh for credible information leading to their arrest. According to the notices made public by the Anantnag police, the suspects are: Hashim Musa alias Suleman, a citizen of Pakistan, Ali Bhai alias Talha Bhai, also a citizen of Pakistan and Abdul Hussain Thokar, a resident of Anantnag district in Jammu and Kashmir. All three are believed to be members of the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba. An MLA in Assam has been arrested over his comments on the terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and Pulwama. Aminul Islam, an MLA of the opposition party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), yesterday claimed the suicide bombing of a convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Pulwama in February 2019, and the killing of 26 tourists in Pahalgam were ""conspiracies by the government"". The Assam Police filed a case on their own (suo motu) against Mr Islam after a video of his comment went viral on social media. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the AIUDF MLA faces treason charges. ""We are trying to take action against anyone who is trying, directly or indirectly, to defend Pakistan after the terror attack. Wave found the statement and videos of MLA Aminul Islam on social media, and he has been found to be supportive of Pakistan, so we filed a case,"" Mr Sarma told reporters. India on Thursday announced that medical visas issued to all Pakistanis will be valid only till April 29, as it stepped up measures against the neighbouring country in the wake of the terror attack in Pahalgam in Anantnag district of Jammu & Kashmir that killed 26 people. In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the government has decided to suspend all visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect. All existing valid visas issued by India to Pakistani nationals stand revoked with effect from April 27. Medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be valid only till April 29, the MEA said, giving the foreigners three-days time to leave the country. ""All Pakistani nationals currently in India must leave India before the expiry of visas, as now amended,"" it said. The words ""La ilaha illallah, Muhammadur rasulullah"" - There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah - are sacred to over a billion Muslims across the world. Known as the Kalima, this declaration of faith is whispered into a newborn's ears, repeated during the five daily prayers, and hoped to be on a believer's lips at the moment of death. It's a declaration of belief in one God and His final messenger, Prophet Muhammad. 'Kalima' is an Arabic word that means ""word"" or ""statement."" In Islam, there are six kalimas. Kalima Tayyib - Declares the oneness of Allah and Muhammad's prophethood. Kalima Shahada - Reaffirms the testimony of faith, often recited when one embraces Islam. Kalima Tamjeed - Glorifies Allah's greatness and mercy. Kalima Tawheed - Speaks of Allah's unity and His power over life and death. Kalima Astaghfar - Seeks forgiveness for both known and unknown sins. Kalima Radde Kufr - Rejects disbelief and sinful actions. In the wake of the devastating terror attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives, the Centre has convened an all-party meeting on Thursday to deliberate on the incident.

""Pakistan continues to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people. The continued Indian state oppression, abrogation of statehood, political and demographic gerrymandering, has persistently led to an organic backlash from the people of IIOJK, which perpetuates cycles of violence. India's systemic persecution of minorities, particularly Muslims, has become more pervasive. Attempts at forced passage of Waqf Bill is the latest effort to marginalize Muslims across India,"" it said. ""India must resist the temptation to exploit such tragic incidents to its advantage and take full responsibility for its failure to provide security to the people,"" it added. According to a statement issued by the Pakistan government, Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) on Thursday, and reviewed the Indian measures announced against Islamabad a day earlier. It said that Pakistan suspends all visas under SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) issued to Indian nationals and deems them cancelled with immediate effect, with the exception of Sikh religious pilgrims. Indian nationals currently in Pakistan under SVES are instructed to exit within 48 hours, less Sikh pilgrims Pakistan also declared the Indian Defence, Naval and Air Advisors in Islamabad persona non grata. They have been directed to leave Pakistan immediately but not later than 30 April 2025. These posts in the Indian High Commission are deemed annulled. Support staff of these Advisors are also directed to return to India, the statement said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and External Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar are currently meeting President Droupadi Murmu. In response to India's severe measures against Pakistan, following the deadly Pahalgam terror attack, Islamabad on Thursday suspended all trade with India. Pakistan's airspace will also be closed with immediate effect for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines, the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said. Besides, the strength of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad will be reduced to 30 diplomats and staff members, from April 31, it said. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said 575 people from Kerala were still in Kashmir and steps have been taken to provide travel, medical assistance and food to those in need. Arrangements, including ticket booking for onward travel, have been made for those arriving in Delhi from Kashmir, the Chief Minister said in a statement issued by his office. Terming the terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam as one which shocked the conscience of the country, Vijayan said it should not be allowed to happen again as it was an assault on humanity itself. ""Our grief is doubled by the fact that there is a Keralite among those who lost their lives there. We share in the grief of the relatives of the deceased N Ramachandran,"" he said. The Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday gave all Pakistani nationals residing in the country three-days time to leave the country. In a statement, it said: ""All existing valid visas issued by India to Pakistani nationals stand revoked with effect from 27 April 2025. Medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be valid only till 29 April 2025. All Pakistani nationals currently in India must leave India before the expiry of visas, as now amended. Indian nationals are strongly advised to avoid travelling to Pakistan."" Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will visit Bangladesh over the weekend, two days after the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which resulted in the deaths of 26 people. While India has taken strong diplomatic steps to counter Pakistan's continued sponsorship of terror activities, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, Bangladesh seems to be steady in its position of maintaining strong ties with Pakistan. Recently, Bangladesh has been warming up to Pakistan, with the Chief Advisor of the Interim Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, calling for stronger ties between the two countries. While Yunus condemned the attack and reaffirmed Bangladesh's resolute stand against terrorism in his statement, warming ties with Pakistan, a country widely seen as a hub for terrorist activities, could harm Bangladesh's long-term interests. A 23-member tourist group from Kerala narrowly escaped the terror attack at Kashmir's Pahalgam as they opted out of going for a horse ride and instead travelled to another nearby location for sight-seeing. Members of the group, which included a child, told reporters at the Kerala House in New Delhi that had they opted for horse-riding, then they too might have been among those killed in the terror attack that claimed 26 lives. ""The rates quoted for the horse ride were too expensive for us. So we took a taxi to another location. From there, we were on the way to Baisaran when we heard some loud sounds, shops were being closed and people were running away. ""We initially did not realise what was happening and asked our guide to take us to another sight-seeing location. But he asked whether we wanted to be alive or go for sightseeing,"" one of the women in the group said.Click here to read more. Several Pakistani nationals visiting India started returning home through the Attari-Wagah land route in Amritsar on Thursday, a day after the Centre set a 48-hour deadline for them to leave the country, PTI reported. According to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the SAARC visa exemption scheme (SVES) and any Pakistani national currently in India under the SVES visa scheme had 48 hours to leave the country. On Thursday morning, several Pakistani families reached the integrated check-post (ICP) in Amritsar to return to the neighbouring country through the Attari-Wagah land route. A family from Karachi said they had gone to Delhi to meet their relatives. ""We came here (India) on April 15 and today we are returning home though we had a visa for 45 days,"" said Shaikh Fazal Ahmad, a member of the family. Responding to a question on the Pahalgam attack, Ahmad said, ""Whosoever has done it is completely wrong. We want mutual brotherhood and friendship between the two nations. There should be no place for hatred. We don't want hatred."" Another Pakistani national named Mansoor said he along with his family came to India on a 90-day visa on April 15. President of Pahalgam Hotels and Owners Association, Javeed Burza, condemned the April 22 dastardly attack by terrorists in which 26 people were killed in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir and expressed grief over the incident. Speaking with ANI, Burza said, ""I condemn this inhuman act. Innocent people were killed, and this is not justified in any way, and we are ashamed of such an incident."" Terming the heinous attack as a ""setback"" for Kashmir, Burza said, ""These were innocent people, they had no relation with politics or terrorism. They just came here to visit. It is heartbreaking. Bharat Bhushan, 35, begged for his life... not for himself, but for his three-year-old child. But, amid the bloodshed in Pahalgam, appeals to the terrorist with an automatic weapon were ignored and Bharat Bhushan was shot in the head, one of 26 killed in Tuesday's attack. He was shot dead just as his wife, child, and he had seen at least two other men killed, disbelieving and terrified, and crouching behind a cluster of tents in the middle of the picturesque green Baisaran Valley, too far from the perimeter to risk making a run to safety. Bollywood movie 'Abir Gulaal', starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, won't release in India, sources in the Centre's Information and Broadcasting Ministry have said, a development that comes amid the nationwide outrage over the heinous terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were shot dead in cold blood. The film, which also stars Vaani Kapoor, was to release on May 9. In less than 48 hours of the Pahalgam terror attack that left 25 tourists and a Kashmiri dead, scenes in the Valley have completely changed from what they were two days back. Flights to Srinagar are empty and those coming out of it are packed with people fleeing the Valley. The Dal Lake, a symbol of Kashmir's unequalled natural beauty, is deserted, a far cry from the bustling scenes two days ago. Shikaras, in high demand till two days ago, are now parked in what is likely to be a long wait for tourists. This attack, which crossed the big red line by targeting tourists, appears to have turned the clock back for the Valley, which was moving fast on its way to recovery from the dark days of militancy. As local hotelowners and traders take to the streets to protest against the attack that has disrupted business in what was turning out to be a season of record tourist inflow, renowned artisans in the Valley worry about what the future holds. Ghulam Rasool Khan, a Jamawar patchwork artist from Srinagar works towards conserving the oldest form of Kashmiri shawl technique. He won the Padma Shri in 2021. Condemning the attack in Pahalgam, he said security agencies must find out ""who are the ones who spoil the atmosphere here"". ""The people here depend completely on tourism. That is the source of livelihood,"" he told NDTV. The artist urged the administration to make every attempt to catch those ""wretched"" perpetrators and bring them before the people. ""Otherwise, after a point, everything is silent and something else happens."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sent a stern message to terrorists and said India will ""identify, track and punish"" every terrorist and their ""backers"" who were behind the deadly Pahalgam attack. At an event in Bihar Thursday, two days after the Pahalgam terror attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a powerful message for the global community - switching from Hindi to English to ensure it resonates around the world. “Everyone who believes in humanity is with us… I thank people, leaders of countries who have stood with us,” PM Modi said at the public event in Bihar. “Every effort will be made to ensure that justice is served.

A crowd of unsuspecting tourists, five to six killers, three focus spots and 10 minutes of heavy firing -- investigation into the Pahalgam terror attack, which left 26 people dead, has thrown up the chilling events at the Baisaran meadow on Tuesday afternoon. Sources in the security establishment have told NDTV that at least five killers were part of the team of terrorists carrying out the attack. The killers emerged from the pine forest next to the meadow and headed towards three spots where tourists were present in large numbers. They were carrying rifles and some reports claim they had bodycams to record the gruesome act. The first shot was fired around 1:50 pm. Horrifying visuals of the attack have shown that the tourists were unaware of the approaching killers till very late. Children were jumping on a trampoline and their parents were enjoyingbhelpuriand admiring the scenic beauty when the shots of death rang through. After the killings, the terrorists fled towards the forest they had come from, security sources have said. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has paid tribute to 31-year-old Shubham Dwivedi, a Kanpur resident killed in the Pahalgam terror attack, and said that terrorists and those who patronised them would now have to face the repercussions of the zero-tolerance approach of the central government. He also said that ""terrorism is breathing its last"" and that the nation must believe in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. ""To ask people their religion before killing them, turning women widows is unacceptable in India,"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Dwivedi's family.जम्मू-कश्मीर के पहलगाम में एक कायरतापूर्ण आतंकी हमले में असमय दिवंगत हुए श्री शुभम द्विवेदी जी के कानपुर स्थित उनके पैतृक आवास पर आज उन्हें अपनी श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित की एवं शोकाकुल परिजनों से भेंट कर उन्हें ढांढस बंधाया।प्रभु श्री राम से प्रार्थना है कि दिवंगत पुण्यात्मा को अपने…pic.twitter.com/bIEF1rS3R5— Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath)April 24, 2025 जम्मू-कश्मीर के पहलगाम में एक कायरतापूर्ण आतंकी हमले में असमय दिवंगत हुए श्री शुभम द्विवेदी जी के कानपुर स्थित उनके पैतृक आवास पर आज उन्हें अपनी श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित की एवं शोकाकुल परिजनों से भेंट कर उन्हें ढांढस बंधाया।प्रभु श्री राम से प्रार्थना है कि दिवंगत पुण्यात्मा को अपने…pic.twitter.com/bIEF1rS3R5 Massive protests have erupted outside the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi amid heightened tensions between the two countries over the Tuesday's terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which resulted in the deaths of 26 people.

The body was later transported to Nellore in Andhra Pradesh by an ambulance. Mr Madhusudan, who was an IT employee from Nellore district, was settled in Bengaluru. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has condemned the Pahalgam terror attack and decided to pause its ongoing protests against the new Waqf law for three days in solidarity with the families of victims. As a mark of solidarity with the bereaved families, the Board has suspended its campaign against the ""controversial amendments"" to the Waqf Act for three days starting April 23, a statement issued by the Muslim organisation said. The Centre will today brief leaders of various political parties on the Pahalgam terror attack and hear their views at an all-party meeting. The decision to call an all-party meeting was taken on Wednesday, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah reaching out to various parties, sources said. With tears in their eyes while still processing the unfathomable sorrow, the families of victims of the Pahalgam terror attack received their bodies on Thursday. Twenty-six people, mostly tourists, died in the Baisaran meadow bloodbath in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag - the deadliest in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama incident - on Tuesday. Among the victims were tourists from different parts of the country and a Nepali national. Their bodies were first brought in coffins to Srinagar, where Union Home Minister Amit Shah laid wreaths, and were then flown to their hometowns. Airlines operated more than 50 flights from Srinagar to ferry tourists and bodies of the victims to their destinations, along with 123 accompanying family members. After Donald Trump, top US administration officials and US lawmakers have now condemned the Pahalgam terror attack and expressed solidarity with India. “I am praying for the Indian people following the tragic terrorist attack in Kashmir. America stands with our dear friends in India and against terrorism in all its forms,” US Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a post on X. Chuck Schumer, New York’s Senator, said his heart breaks for the ""innocent tourists and locals murdered by terrorists in the revolting attack in Kashmir, and I wish a speedy recovery for the injured."" He added that there can be no tolerance for the hatred that breeds ""this kind of unjustifiable violence"". Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said the United States ""stands in strong solidarity with our brothers and sisters in India and Prime Minister Modi"". ""We remain united in our determination to confront terrorism and defeat those who threaten peace and freedom. In unity and strength, we will always overcome,” he added. Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin likened Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir to the late Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, while pinning Pakistan for its role in the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. Mr Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the only difference between Munir and Bin Laden is that the former lives in a palace while the latter lived in a cave. ""The only reaction (to the Pahalgam attack) that the United States should take is a formal designation of Pakistan as a state sponsor of terror and a designation of Asim Munir as a terrorist,"" he told ANI. Mr Rubin used the ""lipstick on a pig"" rhetoric to elaborate that there should be no pretence that the Jammu and Kashmir attack was any sort of ""spontaneous action"". ""As for the timing, just as there was a terrorist attack when Bill Clinton went to India, so too does it seem that Pakistan wants to draw attention away from Vice President JD Vance's trip to India,"" he said.

Pradeep Kumar Saxena, who served as India's Indus Water Commissioner for over six years and has been associated with work related to the IWT, said India, as an upper riparian country, has multiple options. ""This could be the first step towards the abrogation of the Treaty, if the Government so decides,"" Saxena told PTI. ""Although there is no explicit provision in the Treaty for its abrogation, Article 62 of the Vienna Convention on Law of the Treaties provides sufficient room under which the treaty can be repudiated in view of the fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of conclusion of the Treaty,"" he said. Last year, India sent a formal notice to Pakistan, seeking the ""review and modification"" of the treaty. Listing out the steps India could take, Saxena said in the absence of the treaty, India is under no obligation to follow the restrictions on the ""reservoir flushing"" of the Kishanganga reservoir and other projects on Western rivers in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indus Water Treaty currently prohibits it. Flushing can help India desilt its reservoir but then filling the entire reservoir could take days. Under the treaty, reservoir filling after the flushing has to be done in August -- peak monsoon period -- but with the pact in abeyance, it could be done anytime. Doing it when sowing season begins in Pakistan could be detrimental especially when a large part of Punjab in Pakistan depends on the Indus and its tributaries for irrigation.

The new retaliatory measures shut down the few existing diplomatic mechanisms between the two sides taking bilateral relations to yet another new low. At a late evening media briefing, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said ""the defence, military, naval and air advisors in the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi are declared Persona Non Grata"" and they have a week to leave India. India will be withdrawing its own defence, navy and air advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, he said. ""These posts in the respective High Commissions are deemed annulled.

The treaty sets out a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two sides on the use of the waters of a number of cross-border rivers. Under the agreement governing six common rivers, all the water of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually - has been allocated to India for unrestricted use. The waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab - amounting to around 135 MAF annually have been assigned largely to Pakistan. According to the Treaty, India has been given the right to generate hydroelectricity through run of the river projects on the western rivers subject to specific criteria for design and operation. The Treaty also gives the right to Pakistan to raise objections on the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on western rivers. Knowing the 'kalima' (an Islamic declaration of faith) probably led to a professor from Assam narrowly escaping with his life during the terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed. Speaking to NDTV on Wednesday, professor Debashish Bhattacharya, who teaches Bengali at the Assam University in Silchar, recounted seeing a man being shot in front of him and how he ended up reciting the 'kalima' in an act of ""herd mentality"". Mr Bhattacharya said he and his family had gone to Jammu and Kashmir for a holiday and were enjoying the scenery at the picturesque hilltop meadow of Baisaran on Tuesday with hundreds of other tourists around, when they heard a shot ring out. They didn't worry, however, thinking that someone from the forest department had fired to scare away wildlife. ""My family and I saw a man walking near us with a gun and I thought he was from the forest department. He was wearing a black mask and black cap and was talking to a couple. He then shot the husband. My family, I, and some other people ran and lay down under a tree to hide. The attacker walked close to us and shot another man, just a hand's distance away from us, who was trying to lie down,"" said the professor.

The infiltration bid came less than 24 hours after a deadly terror attack at Pahalgam in south Kashmir's Anantnag district left 26 people dead, mostly tourists. The Army said the infiltration bid was foiled in Uri Nala of the north Kashmir district. ""At approximately 0100 hrs, alert troops deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) detected suspicious movement of unidentified persons attempting to infiltrate into Indian territory. The infiltrators were challenged and engaged, resulting in a heavy exchange of fire,"" the Army said in a statement. In the ensuing encounter, it said two terrorists were neutralised.

Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law and businessman Robert Vadra on Wednesday triggered a row by suggesting that non-Muslims were attacked in Pahalgam as terrorists feel Muslims are being ""mistreated"" in the country, with the BJP accusing him of using the language of terrorists and demanding that he apologise. Mr Vadra condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack and said that whenever there are communal issues and people feel vulnerable, there is division in the country and neighbouring countries benefit from it.

The Cabinet Committee Security meeting at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's house over the Kashmir terror attack has concluded. A key parliamentary panel has called off its scheduled tour of Jammu & Kashmir from April 25 following the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam in order to avoid diverting the focus of the security agencies, which are currently fully engaged in handling the situation. The Standing Committee on Home Affairs headed by BJP MP Radha Mohan Das Agrawal was to go on a study tour of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, both Union territories, from April 25 to May 1, official sources told PTI. However, Agrawal conveyed to the members of the panel the decision to defer the tour after the terror attack in which at least 26 persons were shot dead by terrorists. The sources said the decision was necessitated as the MPs, who are part of the committee, would have required heightened security and their engagements included interaction with senior security officials, including the DGP, and other top bureaucrats. ""At a time when they are fully involved in dealing with the aftermath of the terror attack, going after terrorists and reviewing other measures, it would not have been prudent to tax them with our requirements,"" a source said. As the deadly terror attack in Pahalgam in Jammu & Kashmir's Anantnag district triggered fears and caused panic exit among tourists, two women from Maharashtra on Wednesday refused to return home with bitter memories. ""Several people forced us to book flights and told us to come back again (later) because whatever happened was terrifying but we are not scared. We are leaving Pahalgam but we are not leaving Kashmir,"" one of the women told NDTV. The second woman said she was touched by the hospitality of the local residents. ""We trust the local residents here. They way they have been treating us, they have earned our trust. They have always helped us,"" she said. Click here for Kashmir terror attack live updates ""Our driver who has been with us right from the start never asked us for our religion before dropping us to the hotel. (After the attack) He did not care about his safety but prioritised ours. We will continue to travel because this place is so beautiful,"" she added. She was referring to several survivors' claims that the terrorists asked the religion of the victims before killing them. Jammu & Kashmir People's Conference (JKPC) MLA Sajad Lone told NDTV the terrorists who killed 26 tourists at Pahalgam launched a ""multifaceted attack"" to drag the region back to the dark days before special status was scrapped. Mr Lone said the people of Kashmir came out on the streets to reject terror in huge numbers, and they have crossed their threshold. ""They are going to be resilient enough not to get threatened or cowed down by these cowards,"" Mr Lone told NDTV. He said a lot of common people spoke to him, but there was ""a deafening silence"".

Asavari, her mother Pragati and her father rushed to a nearby tent, along with other tourists. They assumed the sound of gunfire outside was an exchange between the attackers and security forces. The sound of the attackers got closer as they fired at a nearby tent. Then came a chilling command ""Chaudhary, tu bahar aa jaa (Chaudhary, you come outside). Her father was pulled out of the tent by attackers, and the following exchange included the attackers blaming them for supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Asavari said there were several tourists around, but the terrorists specifically targeted men after asking whether they were Hindus or Muslims. ""They then asked my father to recite an Islamic verse (probably the Kalma). When he failed to do so, they pumped three bullets into him, one on the head, one behind the ear and another in the back,"" the 26-year-old said, adding that the gunmen then turned to her uncle and shot him repeatedly.

Wired,The Real Winners of the Trump Memecoin Feeding Frenzy,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-memecoin-dinner-winners/,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:30:11 +0000","On Wednesday, the team behind the officialDonald Trump memecoinsparked a trading frenzy after announcing that the investors who held the largest amount of the crypto coin in the coming weeks would be invited to a gala dinner attended by the US president. “At this intimate private dinner, hear first-hand president Trump talk about the future of crypto [sic],” readsthe listingon the TRUMP coin website. “The most exclusive invitation in the world. Only for the top 220 $TRUMP meme coin holders.” The dinner is set to take place on May 22. Traders rushed to buy up the TRUMP coin, some trying to bump themselves onto the invite list and others simply hoping to profit, according to analysis by blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Within an hour, its price hadsurged by almost 60 percent. However, for the two organizations that own 80 percent of the coin’s supply—CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, offshoots of a conglomerate owned by Trump—the market price was a secondary concern. In the immediate term, those firms profit primarily based on how frequently people trade it. When Trumpannounced his memecoinin January, the two organizationsfunneled 10 percent of the total supplyinto a so-called liquidity pool, the purpose of which is to ensure the asset can be traded freely. In return for supplying liquidity and promising to buy and sell the coin as trades come in—known as market making—the Trump-affilitated organizationscommand a fee. That fee ranges from 0.1 to 10 percent of each trade depending on the present level of demand. Think of it like surge pricing on a ride-hailing app. “If you have a coin and you control the market making and the fees generated, what you care about is volume and price movement, not price itself,” says Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon. Previously, Trump-affilitated entities havereportedlyearned tens of millions of dollars in trading fees in connection with the TRUMP coin. In the 24 hours following the dinner announcement, $1.6 million in fees were collected by contributors to the TRUMP liquidity pool on Meteora, the exchange through which the token was originally launched. Most of that money will have accrued to CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight as the largest contributors to the pool, based onprevious reports. On paper, the Trump-affilitated organizations also stand to gain by any appreciation in the price of TRUMP, as they are by far the largest holders. But in practice, they are prevented from selling their stash of coins, partly by a mechanism thatlimits access to their holdingsfor a three-year period, and partly by the prospect of a backlash resulting from the inevitable drop in price caused by any large sales. “The optics of profiting from selling your own coin are terrible, while profiting from the market making is opaque enough to protect your reputation,” says van der Heyden. Meanwhile, anyone who bought into TRUMP as the price surged on Wednesday risks ending up out of pocket. Jockeying for a seat at the gala dinner is a powerful incentive to buy. Once that goes away the price of the Trump coin is likely to fall, analysts say, even if the possibility of future dinners and other perks for owners of the coin might temper any dropoff. “Very likely there would be a slump afterwards,” says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis. Even as the price of TRUMP rose after the announcement, sophisticated crypto investors with a track record of profitability—so-called smart money traders—sold their stakes in the coin, according to Nansen. “Smart money isn’t interested in the TRUMP token, I can tell you that,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen. When Trump first announced his memecoin, days before the inauguration, critics accused the incoming president of embarking on a money-grab at the expense of his regular supporters. Others worried that the coin could act as a vector for bribery; by investing large sums into the coin, driving up its price, politically motivated actors could in theory curry favor with the president surreptitiously. The dinner gambit—an apparent attempt to sell access to the sitting president and manufacture a surge in trading—represents the potential culmination of those fears. The largest holders that have put themselves forward for the dinner are listed in aleaderboardon the TRUMP coin website, but their identities are concealed behind alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. “Crypto industry insiders have pretty much fully understood that Trump’s understanding of crypto is extremely superficial,” claims van der Heyden. “He only cares because he sees potential personal gains.”",article_html/The Real Winners of the Trump Memecoin Feeding Frenzy.html
Wired,‘Who Is Doge?’ Has Become a Metaphysical Question,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-mystery-general-services-administration/,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:27:21 +0000","On March 20, Stephen Ehikian, acting administrator of theGeneral Services Administration, was asked a seemingly simple question during anall-hands meetingwith staff: Who from the GSA worked for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency? To Ehikian, the answer was far from straightforward. “D-O-G-E?” he asked, according to a video obtained by WIRED and sources with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. “You’re talking about DOGE?” Then he clarified: “There is no DOGE team inside of GSA. “I’ve never seen a leader lose credibility in real time before,” says a current GSA employee. “It was like the ‘plummeting’ sound in a cartoon. We all see the team there. There’s an entire section of the building blocked off where they work.” The GSA, which manages federal office buildings and IT, was anearly DOGE target, with Musk-linked individuals swiftly infiltrating the agency after Trump took office. As the team began working out of the GSA headquarters in Washington, DC, the agency ramped up its physical security. A section of the sixth floor, which had previously stood open, was blocked by a guard and a door, which now requires a key card to enter. That is where Ehikian and the DOGE team work, according to current staff members. In fact, at least a half dozen DOGE affiliates, including Musk’s top lieutenant Steve Davis and former Palantir internAkash Bobba, are currently listed in the GSA employee directory and have GSA email addresses. All are tied directly to the administrator’s office, at the highest level of the GSA org chart. Two additional names with ties to Musk-owned companies recently appeared in the directory as well: Dave Malcher, who previously worked at SpaceX, and Raj Jegannathan, VP of information security and internal apps at Tesla. These names, and their association with the GSA, have not been previously reported. The GSA and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED. The ambiguity around who is and is not DOGE starts with the fact that there are in fact two DOGEs: therepurposed US Digital Service, now known as the US DOGE Service, and a temporary organization within the US DOGE Service called, naturally, the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization, which is tasked with carrying out the DOGE agenda. In some cases, DOGE affiliates are hired directly into federal agencies. In other cases, they are detailed to those agencies temporarily. Since Donald Trump retook the White House in January, people with ties to Elon Musk or his companies have popped up all over the federal government. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer, nowleads the Technology Transformation Services. Michael Grimes, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley who helped finance the Twitter deal, is now a senior adviser at the Commerce Department. Even Ehikian, while not a DOGE employee, is married to a former designer at Musk’s social media company X and has taken up the mantle of cost-cutting, targeting 50 percent reductions in spend across the GSA. All appear to be carrying out Trump's DOGE agenda, although they do not work for DOGE directly. The question of who DOGE is has taken on an almost metaphysical quality as the organization’s mandate has expanded. According to Trump’s January 20 executive order establishing DOGE, every federal agency is required to create a DOGE team of at least four employees. (Ehikan’s claim that there is no DOGE team at the GSA may be technically true, but if so, the agency would seem to be in violation of the order.) Those teams—some members of which are career civil servants and certainly not DOGE employees of any description—were originally tasked with carrying out DOGE’s stated mission to make the government more efficient. But subsequent orders, including a March 20 order to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and data silos, havemassively widened the scope of DOGE’s work, leading one set of plaintiffs to allege that “‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ are not magic words, and they cannot conjure up a need to grant DOGE Team members on-demand access to Americans’ most sensitive and personal information,” according to a lawsuit filed by the AFL-CIO and other labor groups. All of this means that the line between who is working for DOGE and who is enthusiasticallydoingDOGE is blurry at best. Take DOGE affiliate and former Tesla employee Riley Sennott, who according to a recent Business Insiderreportwas listed as a “senior adviser” at NASA and also appeared to work for the GSA. Sennott was listed as an “IT specialist” GS-15 employee on the GSA’s payroll at the time, WIRED confirmed. Sennott’s journalist father, Charles Sennott, published a column later that month in the Columbia Journalism Review explicitly stating that his son works at the GSA—not DOGE. “It is fair to say that Riley’s current work is part of a broad effort that the public has come to know as DOGE,” the elder Sennottwrote—but also argued that “the General Services Administration is not the same as Elon Musk’s self-proclaimed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.” A number of other high-profile DOGE team members, includingEdward “Big Balls” Coristine, Ethan Shaotran, Nicole Hollander, Jeremy Lewin, Luke Farritor, Kyle Schutt, Nathan Cavanaugh, Justin Aimonetti, and Ashley Boizelle, were listed on the GSA payroll at the time Ehikian made his comments at the March 20 all hands, according to documents viewed by WIRED. (Coristine, Shaotran, Hollander, and Farritor are listed as having salaries of $0, while the others collect from $120,000 to more than $150,000 annually.) Sara Sami, the president of an HR consultancy serving federal agencies, says this doesn’t necessarily confirm that they work within the agency, since the GSA processes payroll for other agencies and committees. “They could be classified as DOGE employees, but their pay could be run through the GSA,” she says. GSA employees can also bedetailedto other agencies. Still, GSA employees say they see DOGE affiliates in the office every week. WIRED has confirmed sightings of Coristine, Shaotran, Farritor, Cavanaugh, Gavin Kliger, and Marko Elez over the past few months. “They’re young tech bros walking around together,” says a current GSA employee. “It’s obvious who they are,” agrees another.",article_html/‘Who Is Doge’ Has Become a Metaphysical Question.html
Wired,Scientists Find Measles Likely To Become Endemic in the US Over Next 20 Years,https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-measles-likely-to-become-endemic-in-us-polio-diphtheria-rubella/,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:55:59 +0000","With vaccination ratesamong US kindergarteners steadily declining in recent years and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. Anew analysispublished today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts. Using a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.” The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns. Elimination means there has been no chain of disease transmission inside a country lasting longer than 12 months. The current measles outbreak in Texas, however, could put that status at risk. With more than 600 cases, 64 hospitalizations, and two deaths, it’s the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1992, when 990 cases were linked to a single outbreak. Nationally, the US has seen800 cases of measles so far in 2025, the most since 2019. Last year, there were 285 cases. “We’re really at a point where we should be trying to increase vaccination as much as possible,” says Mathew Kiang, assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper. Childhood vaccination in the US has been on a downward trend. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state and local vaccination programs found that from the 2019–2020 school year to the 2022–2023 school year, coverage among kindergartners with state-required vaccinationsdeclined from 95 percent to approximately 93 percent. Those vaccines included MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), polio, and chickenpox. In the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study. Under a scenario with a 10 percent decline in measles vaccination, the model estimates 11.1 million cases of measles over the next 25 years, while a 5 percent increase in the vaccination rate would result in just 5,800 cases in that same time period. In addition to measles, the authors used their model to assess the risk of rubella, polio, and diphtheria. The researchers chose these four diseases for their infectiousness and risk of severe complications. While sporadic cases of these diseases do occur and are usually related to international travel, they are no longer endemic in the US, meaning they no longer regularly occur. The model predicted that rubella, polio, and diphtheria are unlikely to become endemic under current levels of vaccination. Rubella and polio have a basic reproduction number of four, while diphtheria’s is less than three. In 81 percent of simulations, vaccination rates would need to fall by around 35 percent for rubella to become endemic in the next 25 years. Polio, meanwhile, had a 50 percent chance of becoming endemic if vaccination rates dropped 40 percent. Diphtheria was the least likely disease to become reestablished. “Any of these diseases, under the right conditions, could come back,” says coauthor Nathan Lo, a Stanford physician and assistant professor of infectious diseases. To evaluate the validity of the model, the researchers ran a scenario with recent state-level vaccine coverage rates over a five-year period and found that the number of model-predicted cases broadly aligned with the number of observed cases in those years. The authors also found that Texas was at the highest risk for measles. One limitation of the study was that the model assumed that vaccination rates were the same across all communities within a state. It didn’t take into account large variations in vaccination levels. Pockets of low vaccination rates, like in the Mennonite community at the center of the West Texas outbreak, would likely lead to local outbreaks that are larger than expected given the overall vaccination rate. The study also didn’t take into account the possibility that vaccination rates could rebound in an area in response to an outbreak. “That’s the thing that we have control over. If you’re able to change that cycle, then that disease won’t spread anymore,” says Mujeeb Basit, associate chief of the Clinical Informatics Center at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the study. Kiang and Lo say the full impact of decreased vaccination will likely not be seen for decades. “It’s important to note that it’s totally feasible that vaccinations go down and nothing happens for a little while. That’s actually what the model says,” Kiang says. “But eventually, these things are going to catch up to us.”",article_html/Scientists Find Measles Likely To Become Endemic in the US Over Next 20 Years.html

What’s WIRED About Motorola Phones Motorola phones have a simple Android interface.This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it. They come with lots of storage.The company stuffs 256 GB as standard into most of its smartphones, even some of the cheap models. Most Android flagship devices still come with just 128 GB. Motorola is also one of the only phone brands to still include a microSD card slot to expand storage on many of its devices, and the Moto G phones retain the headphone jack. There’s broad carrier support.While some Android phone brands have inconsistent carrier support in the US, likeNothing, Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company listscarrier support detailsin the Specs section of all its phones). They all work on the big three—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. Make sure you buy them unlocked. The prices dip quite often.Never buy a Motorola phone at its MSRP. They almost always go on sale a few months (or weeks) after launch, sometimes at steep discounts. What’s TIRED About Motorola Phones Motorola’s software updates are lackluster.The company is slowly improving here—it promises to deliver three Android OS updates and four years of bimonthly security updates to its high-end smartphones but stilllags behind its peers. Most of the Moto G phones only receive one OS Android update—though this is changing in 2025 with new devices gettingtwoupgrades—along with three years of security updates. Fewer updates mean you miss out onnew Android featuresquickly. Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive. The cameras are lackluster.Among the things putting Motorola behind the likes of Samsung and Google are the cameras. Moto phones can takefinephotos but they’re eclipsed by their peers. Motorola made some improvements with its high-end phones but it's still behind. There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but it's a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally broke the mold with always-on displays, but it's still not present in other devices. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu If you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it. When closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can use the superior primary cameras—typically on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap. Open it up and there's a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor versus the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devicesin 2024. That said, performance was smooth, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage. This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch-up with much of the competition. Photos take some time to process, too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with most of the results. I wish Motorola had kept the ultrawide camera. In its predecessor, using the front screen as a preview made it simple to take selfies with others. Now, with the default 50-MP main camera, fitting more people into the frame is a challenge. The ultrawide has been replaced by a 2X telephoto lens. While I'm usually a fan of zooming in, the zoom level is underwhelming, and the quality is mediocre. There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+, and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great in the newhot pink color,and runs well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu This is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, especially on sale. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance, but it's still big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that sometimes made it annoying to use. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu This phone is frequently on sale for $330, and it's a no-brainer for anyone on a budget. You get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset, but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay, and it's leagues better than the performance you'll find on the other Motorola phones featured below. It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks, and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily, and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory. I do have a few gripes, though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying. Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where a phone like theGoogle Pixel 9ahandily beats the Edge 2024. Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 9a will get seven years of software support. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but this may not be as much of an issue at its frequent $330 sale price. If you're wondering about a successor, the Motorola Edge launched in June 2024, so you can expect a follow-up this summer. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Moto G Stylus 2025 is the best Moto G phone right now, which might be a given considering it's the priciest model in the family. Still, for $400, it's one of the best smartphone values on the market. As the name suggests, it comes with a built-in stylus—the only other phone with that feature is Samsung’s$1,300 Galaxy S25 Ultra. This is a slim and beautifully blue phone. My mom said it looked nice. Even a stranger stopped me to ask what phone I was using! The Surf the Web blue really pops with the vegan leather back, though you can get it in a more muted Gibraltar Sea color. You'll notice aheadphone jackon the bottom, a rarity in today's smartphone climate, and pop open the SIM tray to find a spot to add a microSD card, anotherrapidly disappearing feature. Motorola also includes 256 GB of storage, a nice bump compared to pricier smartphones that offer only 128 gigs. You geta 120-HzAMOLED 6.7-inch screen that's plenty bright in sunny conditions, and satisfactory, stutter-free performance with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset. It might not feel the speediest, but this is the smoothest-performing Moto G; I've rarely seen choppy animations in the interface. Speaking of, there's a good deal of bloatware apps in theAndroid 15operating system, but they're easy to uninstall. The 5,000-mAh battery in tow has frequently lasted a full day for me with roughly 35 percent left by bedtime, with average to high use. It's not quite a two-day phone. You can top it back up fairly quickly with Motorola's 68-watt TurboPower charging system, but I've largely juiced it with myQi wireless chargerwith no problems. I've been impressed with the 50-megapixel main camera. It takes crisp photos in good lighting, and in low-light settings Motorola's Night mode does a nice job of preserving details and shadows. The catch is you need to be very still—any movement and you'll end up with a blurry shot. (I have a few of those in my camera roll.) I think most people will be happy with the results. The problem? There is a significantly better phone for just $100 more: theGoogle Pixel 9a. Google will support that device for seven years, and it also comes with flagship-grade performance, better cameras, and more smart software features. The Moto G Stylus will only get two Android OS upgrades and three years of security updates. This is precisely why you should buy it on sale. Wait for this Moto phone to drop to $300 or $330. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu I would buy the Motorola Edge 2024 at its $330 sale price over the newer Moto G Power 2025 (7/10, WIRED Recommends), but if you wait forthisphone to go on sale, it'll be a great buy. A few months after the Moto G Power 2024 launched, it dipped as low as $250—if the same happens again here, that would make the 2025 model a better proposition. Last year's Moto G Powerwas fantastic. It introduced wireless charging—a rarity on a sub-$300 phone—had good performance, and checked off many boxes. This year's version retains much of that and adds even more: It's nowIP68/69 rated, meaning it will be fine in heavy rain and even submerged in water for some time. Motorola is also promisingtwoAndroid OS upgrades, giving these budget phones a slightly longer shelf life. Unfortunately, it took two steps forward and one step back: The performance got a slight hit. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset inside delivers decent speed, but the stutters are more noticeable. It's not frustrating to operate, but I wish it were as fluid as the 2024 Moto G Power. If you can deal with that, this is still a capable and attractive budget Android phone. I like the green color and the fake leather texture on the back, which gives this phone some character. The 6.8-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. The 5,000-mAh battery can last a good while into a second day with average use, though heavy usage ended my days with around 30 percent left. The camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-MP ultrawide, and a 16-MP selfie camera. Photos from the primary shooter are adequate, even in low light, though skin tones and colors can be off. The ultrawide and selfie cameras are only worth using if it's daytime or you have lots of light. Much of this is par for the course with phones in this price bracket. If its performance was a smidge better, this Moto would be a home run. It's worth considering if money's tight, but there will inevitably be a sale to make the price more palatable. Motorola Moto G 2025 I suggest you stick to the phones above, but read on if your budget is tight. Moto G 2025 for $197:The new Moto G 2025 straddles the line of annoying and capable. Its performance—powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 and 4 GB of RAM—is sluggish. It can visibly take a few seconds for some apps to load. Sometimes it's fine and manageable, and other times I find myself staring off into the distance, waiting for the phone to work. The cameras are passable, the battery can last more than a day, and the 6.7-inch LCD is adequate. This phone will eventually go on sale for $150 or $170, so wait for the discount. It will thankfully get two OS updates and three years of security updates. Moto G Play 2024 You should avoid buying any other Moto G phone from 2024 or earlier. They likely won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. Moto G Play 2024 for $128:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivers reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate. It's unclear if Motorola is planning a successor in 2025. Motorola Edge 2023 for $264:The 2023 6.7-inch Motorola is not too different in price from the 2024 model, so there's no good reason to buy this dated model anymore. Motorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 9a ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone, including wireless charging. Nothing also has new devices, thePhone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro. They're attractive, elegant, and affordable handsets, though carrier compatibility is not as straightforward. Nothing's sub-brand CMF is also expected to announce a new cheap handset, theCMF Phone 2 Pro, and it will likely give Motorola a run for its money. If your budget can stretch, consider theGalaxy S24 FE ($650), theOnePlus 13R ($500), or even theiPhone 16e. But your best bang for your buck? That'd be hunting for used flagship phones from the prior year. Make sure you check sites likeSwappa,Back Market, andGazelle. Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options. Moto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera. Smart Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on somecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Smart Connect. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only)or theSmart Connect appif you’re connecting an Android tablet. If you’re using a TV, it needsMiracast supportto connect wirelessly, but you can use a USB-C or HDMI cable as well. Meta recently announced that Smart Connect will also be available for virtual reality headsets in the Meta Store, so you don't have to take a Meta Quest VR headset off just to look at your phone's notifications. Moto AI:This isMotorola's version of Apple Intelligence. There are several core artificial intelligence features, like Remember This, which lets you ask Moto AI to remember something (even a screenshot), and allows you to ask about it later on. Pay Attention is another that enables audio recording, real-time transcribing, and a summary after the meeting is over. Catch Me Up summarizes your notifications when you come back to your phone after some time.","article_html/The Best Motorola Phones (2025), Tested and Reviewed.html"
Wired,Gmail’s New Encrypted Messages Feature Opens a Door for Scams,https://www.wired.com/story/gmail-end-to-end-encryption-scams/,"Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:00:00 +0000","Google announced at the beginning of April that it is launching a streamlined tool that will allow business users to easily send“end-to-end encrypted” emails—an effort to address the longstanding challenge of adding additional security protections to email messages. The feature is currently in beta for enterprise users to try out within their own organization. It will then expand to allow Google Workspace users to send end-to-end encrypted emails to anyGmailuser. By the end of the year, the feature will allow Workspace users to send the more secure emails to any inbox. Email spam and digital fraud researchers warn, though, that while the feature will provide a new option for email privacy and security, it will also inevitably spawn new phishing attacks. End-to-end encryption is a protection that keeps data scrambled at all times except on the sender and recipient's devices, and it is difficult to add to the historic email protocol. Mechanisms to do it are typically very complicated and costly to implement and only make sense for large organizations trying to meet specific compliance requirements. In contrast, Google's end-to-end encrypted email tool is simple to use and doesn't require significant IT overhead. The scenario that digital fraud researchers are most concerned about, though, relates to the case where a Workspace user sends an end-to-end encrypted email to a non-Gmail user. “When the recipient is not a Gmail user, Gmail sends them an invitation to view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail,” Google wrote in a blog post. “The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email.” The fear is that scammers will take advantage of this new and more secure communication mechanism by creating fake copies of these invitations that contain malicious links, and prompt targets to enter their login credentials for their email, single sign-on services, or other accounts. “Looking at Google's implementation, we can see it introduces a new workflow for non-Gmail users—receiving a link to view an email,” says Jérôme Segura, senior director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes. “Users might not yet be familiar with exactly what a legitimate invitation looks like, making them more susceptible to clicking on a fake one.” Given email's technical limitations, Google created a way for an organization's Workspace to automatically manage keys—used to descramble encrypted messages. Key management is what makes end-to-end encrypting email so difficult, so offering a solution that is easy for customers is a departure from what's currently available. The fact that the organization's Workspace controls the keys rather than storing them locally on a sender and recipient's devices does mean that the featuredoesn't quite qualify as end-to-end encryptionin the strictest sense of the term. But researchers say that for use cases like business compliance, the tool could still be extremely useful. And individuals who want end-to-end encrypted communications should just usea purpose-built app like Signal. When Gmail users receive one of the new encrypted emails from a Google Workspace user, Google's extensive array of dynamic spam filters and fraud detection mechanisms will be in play to protect against spam, phishing, and rogue imposters broadly. But email users outside the Google ecosystem will also be able to receive encrypted email invitations, which makes the service available to anyone, but also will leave non-Google users to their own devices. Scammers will prey on anything topical to generate new scams, and this threat certainly isn't unique to Google's new encrypted email feature. The invitations to view end-to-end encrypted emails will come with a warning that says, “Be careful when signing in to view this encrypted message. This message is from an external sender and is encrypted. Make sure you trust the sender and their identity provider before entering your username and password.” “While it’s absolutely true that scammers are always looking for new ways to abuse any product, we built this particular technology with this risk in mind,” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer said in a statement. “The notifications users will receive in this case are very similar to Drive file sharing notifications that go out whenever someone shares a doc or file. All the protections we employ to keep scammers from capitalizing on these messages will help us protect this new class of notifications as well.” Generations ofGoogle DriveandGoogle Docsscams show, though, that it is particularly difficult to combat imposter invitations outside of Google's ecosystem. But when it comes to the new end-to-end encrypted email feature, “it was either adding a warning or not allowing this feature for non-Gmail users,” Malwarebytes's Segura says. In fact, the new tool may offer particularly good fodder for scammers, given that Google is such a trusted organization, and targets may have heard about how end-to-end encryption is a special, gold-standard security feature. “It's almost as if someone at Google knew this was a bad idea and asked for a warning to be added,” Malwarebytes’ Segura says. “It's quite likely fraudsters will jump on the opportunity to craft phishing emails using this exact same template, even including the original warning that will be overlooked.”",article_html/Gmail’s New Encrypted Messages Feature Opens a Door for Scams.html
